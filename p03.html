         <h1>Trayble</h1>
         <h2>September 2016 - January 2017</h2>
         <h3>Summary</h3>
         <p>Students in the McMaster Engineering program are assigned a client with a specific problem that needs to be solved.  Students brainstorm, design and implement a working solution to be presented to peers and teachers. Out of more than 250 groups, the top 10 projects are entered into a showcase attended by the clients themselves, as well as professors, peers, and the media. After all groups have presented their project, the client, with the help of industry professionals choose the best project which is then adapted by the client. </p>
         <p> Our project, the trayble was entered into the showcase and <span>awarded best presentation. </span></p>
         <h3>Client & Problem</h3>
         <p> Our client was the St. Peter's Residence at Chedoke, a long-term care residence. They noticed that the tables they used in their dining hall could only be adjusted to a single height, and made it difficult for residents with different wheelchair sizes to sit comfortably at the same table. </p>
         <h3> Solution </h3>
         <p> Our solution was the trayble. A cheap, lightweight and modular tray attachement that could be installed on any table and provided an easy way to adjust individual heights. Our focus was usability, we wanted all residents to be able to adjust the height without assistance from staff, in an effort to maintain their independance.

         <h3> Takeaway </h3>
         <p> The engineering design competition was a great experience. It taught me a lot about time management, and the design process. We had to go through multiple designs to get to our final product, and we couldn't be happier with how it turned out. </p>
