      <p> Cryptex is a Java application that lets users view, compare and sort different available cryptocurrencies. </p>
      <h3> Summary</h3>
      <p>Crytpex was created as a project for SFWRENG 2XA3. It uses the CryptoCompare public API for getting the data which gave me valuble experience on integrating a RESTful API into an application. This was a group project, and my role was creating the software architecture, and creating the coin and coinlist models and API handlers. </p>
