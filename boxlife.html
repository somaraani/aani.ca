      <h1>BoxLife</h1>
      <h2>March 2016 - June 2016</h2>
      <p> BoxLife was my first attempt at making a platformer game. It was created for the summaitve of ICS3U1 (Computer Science), and was created using processing. BoxLife was voted best computer science project of the 2014/2015 year and was awarded 100%. </p>
      <h3> Summary</h3>
      <p>BoxLife is a maze based puzzle game that is extremely challenging. You have a set number of lives to beat all 10 levels. Each level has a time-limit. Dying due to obstacles/enemies or running out of time will reset the level and take away one of your lives. How fast can you beat all 10 levels? </p>

      <h3>Proposal</h3>
      <p> This is the proposal that was created before beginning working on the game. Although some things did change during development, the main ideas and concepts are the same as was pitched in this initial design. </p>

      <h3>Download</h3>
      <p> See if you can beat the game yourself! (Hint: pressing 0-9 keys on your keyboard will teleport you through the different levels but you won't be able to get a highscore anymore)</p>
